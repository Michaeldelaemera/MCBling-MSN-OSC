# 3.FAQ

# 1: Is MCB MSN a copy of Windows Live Messenger?

No. MCBling MSN is not a copy or fork of Microsoft’s original Windows Live Messenger.
It is an independent, original project built entirely from scratch by the community, inspired by the nostalgia and features of the classic Messenger.

While it recreates the experience and feel of WLM, it uses its own code, design, and style — most notably, the unique MCBling aesthetic.

# 2: Will MCB MSN be an Open Source Community (OSC)?

Yes. MCBling MSN is a 100% Open Source Community project.
That means:

🛠️ The code will be publicly available for anyone to use, modify, or improve.

👥 There is no central authority or single owner; the community drives the project.

🌍 Contributions are welcome from developers, designers, translators, and enthusiasts worldwide.

🔄 Transparency and collaboration are at the heart of MCB MSN.

The goal is to rebuild a nostalgic Messenger-like experience together, in a free and open way.

# 3: Why doesn’t MCB MSN have an official brand account?

Because MCBling MSN is an OSC (Open Source Community) project, it has no “official company” or central brand account.

Instead, the project lives in its GitHub repository and in the contributions of the community. Updates, progress, and discussions happen openly there.

This decentralized approach ensures that no single person or entity controls MCB MSN — it belongs to everyone who contributes to it.

# 4: Can Microsoft shut down MCB MSN?

No. MCBling MSN is an independent, original project built from scratch.

It uses its own code, servers, and independent databases, and does not reuse Microsoft’s code, servers, or trademarks.

The project is only inspired by the nostalgia and user experience of the classic Messenger, but the program itself is 100% new, unique, and community-driven.

Therefore, Microsoft has no ownership or control over MCB MSN.

# 5: How can I collaborate or contribute?

Anyone can join! Since MCB MSN is an Open Source Community (OSC) project, contributions are always welcome.

You can contribute by creating forks, which means you can build your own variants and experiments thanks to the free and open code.

⚠️ However, the official MCBling MSN program (the compiled version released under the MCB brand) is closed and maintained separately, similar to how Google manages Android.
