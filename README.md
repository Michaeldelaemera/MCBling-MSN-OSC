# MCBling-MSN-OSC

MCBling MSN OSC is a moldable code resource for creating your own from-scratch reconstruction of Windows Live Messenger, with a nostalgic MCBling aesthetic ✨.

This project provides a clean front-end base (login, contacts, chat, loading screen) that anyone can customize, expand, or connect to their own backend. It’s not a full messenger — it’s a foundation to spark creativity and bring back the early 2000s MSN vibes.

⚠️ Warning

The original discarded logo for this program is my personal property and is not included in this open-source release.
Only the front-end code (HTML, CSS, JS) is shared here under an open license.

Users are free to replace the placeholder logo with their own design, but the original MCBling MSN logo remains copyrighted and private.
